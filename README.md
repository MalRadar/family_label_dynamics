# Android Malware Family Labeling

## Overview
This study examines the challenges in labeling Android malware families, focusing on results in widely-used tools like AVClass and Euphony. 
Using a large dataset from Google Play and third-party markets, we reveal how these tools struggle with temporal inconsistencies, label evolution, and handling multi-family malware. 
Our findings highlight the need for improved labeling methods to ensure more reliable threat detection and security. 
The data used in this study are available to support further research and industry applications.
